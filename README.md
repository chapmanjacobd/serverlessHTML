### ServerlessHTML

Demo: https://unli.xyz/ServerlessHTML/

This is kind of a silly thing. But Alpine.js basically made it a one-liner so I built it.

You can think of it as Google Docs but no data is stored on the server. Everything is stored in the URL--the link itself.

How long can your document be?

- If you need IE support, only up to 4,043 characters
- Chrome: up to 32,779 characters
- The max length in Firefox and Safari seems to be unlimited, but best under 65,000 characters--about the same as a Facebook post limit

A StackOverflow page is somewhere around 362,801 characters.
